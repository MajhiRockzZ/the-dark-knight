# âš¡ The Dark Knight ðŸ¦‡

A VS Code dark theme for contrast for nighttime coding. ðŸŒ‘

## Motivation

It was really time consuming to setup you code editor overtime you switch different machine. Also i have been always switching back and forth from one color scheme to other according to my preference as not all color scheme will have what you want for your perfect setup. And have a feature for color scheme community was really time consuming. So I decided to build my own and here it is hope you will love it as i do.
