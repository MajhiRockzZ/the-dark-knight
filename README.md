### *⚠ This is a temporary version of this color sceme, The theme will be going to take a lot of up's📈 and down's💹 during its development process so hold on tight and enjoy the roller-coaster ride.*

It was really time consuming to setup you code editor overtime you switch different machine. Also I have been always switching back and forth from one color scheme to other according to my preference as not all color scheme will have what you want for your perfect setup. So I decided to build my own and here it is hope you will love it as i do. The Dark Knight is a theme created using some of the best features from my three favourite color scheme [Dracula](https://github.com/dracula/visual-studio-code), [Night Owl](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme), and [Shades of Purple](https://github.com/ahmadawais/shades-of-purple-vscode) a huge thanks to them for their great work.
